# Title: A New Journey - Learning iOS Development

## Inspiration: 

My experience in web development gave me an insight on how important it is for my clients to not only have a full-blown website that is viewable from personal computers and laptops. They reiterated that they want their customers to view their websites from mobile devices. So, I developed websites that are portable, responsive and mobile-friendly, I had used JavaScript Frameworks like Meteor, Adobe PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile and React Native.

#### *Android Development:*

In 2017, I successfully completed an Android native development course from Udacity and created some apps for Android devices:

#### *Journey in Learning: iOS Development*

I had enrolled in Coursera's iOS Development Professional Certificate program that is offered by Meta or Facebook. The certification may take a year and a half to finish, but I may be able to take courses that are not prerequisites of each other simultaneously:

#### *The X Code IDE:*

So far, I am impressed with the straight-forwardness of the user interface for iOS IDE (Integrated Development Environment): the X Code. Here are some screenshots:

#### My Development Machines: 

For this journey, I will be using my Macbook Air that I normally use to create my music: I am excited to start, learn and create Apps for Apple, soon.

# Next Steps:

I also enrolled in four other Meta certificates offered by Udacity:

![meta-database-front-end](/assets/images/iosdev/meta-database-front-end.png)

I am assured that learning these will help me learn a wide spectrum of mobile development stack and along with my cybersecurity and DevOps experience, I hope to expand my professional horizons.
