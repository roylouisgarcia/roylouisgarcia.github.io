Do I still have what it takes to effectively learn a new language. Another journey begins. I enrolled in one of the major MOOC learning platform, Coursera. The certification may take a year and a half to finish, but I may be able to take courses that are not prerequisites of each other simultaneously:</p>

Normally, giving storage space to newer data is a prirority that is why most systems clean up their logs or historical data for after some time. The decrease in cost of storage devices made possible to keep historical logs longer than usual.</p>

As a <strong>designer</strong>, developer and even a self-proclaimed artist, I often struggle with finalizing any project or creation that I have to offer to clients, students, or audience. The notion of change, movement, refactoring, versioning, evolution and other variation of not being complacent with the “current moment” engulf my mind. Even when I find the clarity to put a period, deadline or finality on whatever I am saying, working on, or creating, something at the back of my mind expects that one day I would have to revisit these <em>obra maestro</em>.</p>

These two are often required in most courses I took from teachers in traditional, online, and MOOC schools. As I progress in my career in computer security, I advocate the search for the right balance in security and privacy. I currently help local companies to embrace the need of security while providing ease in computing and acquiring the peace of mind that data is projected.</p>

My work place is aware that I am applying for the masters program at CSUMB. Last week, my supervisor and his two business analysts discussed how I should help create some documentation of the workflows that I am slowly getting accustomed to. This was necessary in case I plan to progress my role within the company. I had been introducing some more efficient processes that I learned fresh from school and they want others to benefit from it. I was more than willing to share my knowledge.</p>
