    <p><img class="image-left" src="/assets/images/personal/time.jpg" />This week at <strong>XL Design Professionals</strong> (XLDP), I only worked 8.5 hours because I took some time off to devote some time for paper works involving school. My work place is aware that I am applying for the masters program at CSUMB. Last week, my supervisor and his two business analysts discussed how I should help create some documentation of the workflows that I am slowly getting accustomed to. This was necessary in case I plan to progress my role within the company. I had been introducing some more efficient processes that I learned fresh from school and they want others to benefit from it. I was more than willing to share my knowledge.</p>

<hr />

<p>Most of the things that I do are technical in nature and someone else needs to learn how to do some of these tasks like:</p>

<p><img class="image-left" src="/assets/images/personal/tasks.jpg" /></p>
<ol>
  <li>manage backup tapes to be delivered to our data center</li>
  <li>monitor and support XL Design Professional Policy Issues mailbox</li>
  <li>monitor and support XL Microsoft Helpdesk issues</li>
  <li>administer migration/connection between data/reports from various databases that are essential to office procedures and some administrative tasks that can be requested irregularly.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>From the time I stated, I was asked to document these procedures and in my absence, I made these documents/instructions public so someone else in the office will be able to do them when I am not around.</p>

<p>The long term projects that I finished include:</p>

<p><img class="image-left" src="/assets/images/personal/projects.jpg" /></p>
<ol>
  <li>make over of an extranet website</li>
  <li>a programming project that will meet the following Security Requirements for password validation that is described in the “Identification and Authentication Standards – QM6015GBL Version 2.1” of FIC (Framework Internal Control) requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>Administrator accounts or supervisor accounts must be 12 characters passwords.</li>
      <li>Never be the same as the User ID</li>
      <li>Not contain more than two consecutive, identical characters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><img class="image-left" src="/assets/images/personal/challenges.jpg" /> A programming project that I started satisfies the same requirement as above but involves creation of additional fields and tables to an extranet application database.</p>

<p>The challenges I have is to be patient when you do not have the right access or privilege to do something. I am always anxious to get the job done but I know that it is not possible especially if you are working with teams. I learned that every technical or non-technical procedure in a developing company should be accounted for.</p>

<hr />

<p><img class="image-left" src="/assets/images/personal/learnings.jpg" /> I learned the value of formal documentation of procedured in the office. I also had a taste of how to be meticulous and detail-oriented when dealing with audits. Overall, even as a mere intern, I need to adhere and be familiar with the company’s business standards and requirements. Aside from all the technical knowledge, business procedures, and team collaboration that I learned from the internship, I also gained appreciation on how people build a long-lasting ecosystem that promotes learning and growth.</p>
