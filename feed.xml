I would like to share my work flow in learning MOOC courses, Youtube video tutorials, audiobooks, e-books and tutorials online. We all learn differently.

<p>Learning is not fun, but you can make it tolerable and seemingly fun. Well all are affected by mood swings, energy level and are bounded by rules and scarcity of time. If order to be effective, learning requires some knowledge retention plan. The books shown above contain some recommendations to improve the way our limited biological brain can retain more information if aided by technology and reinforced with some habits.</p>

<p>One technological tool that I use is the <a href="https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/">Cherry Tree Note Taking program:</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/learningworkflow/learning_2.png" alt="learning_2" /></p>

<p>Using Cherry Tree, I apply the PARA method concepts that I learn from the book:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/learningworkflow/learning_3.png" alt="learning_3" /></p>

<p>This note-taking program, has features that serve my needs, like having a means to export notes into pdf or html. I am also able to automate the creation of sub menus or subnodes that categorize the subjects of my notes. It is easy to write automated bash/python/dos batch scripts to create them in bulk. It does lack the ability to right click on images and copy text into the clipboard, just like Microsoft’s OneNote can. Since I am a Microsoft 365 user, I just use OneNote along side Cherry Tree:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/learningworkflow/learning_3b.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I keep track of what I do by using git and a local git (not github.com) server so I can  sync my notes from various devices on my own secured network. At the end of the day, when you try to assess if you were just busy and not productive, having some means to keep track of what you accomplish is vital and rewarding.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/learningworkflow/learning_4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ultimately, I try to “apply” what I learn to serve my daily learning needs. For example, I wrote a python/bash script to automate what I submit for Udacity’s 60 day challenge. Of course, I tweak some words to apply to what I really accomplished vs what I planned to do, if needed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/learningworkflow/learning_5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I guess, I just try to balance theoretical learning with practical application of what I am learning. I practice even my typing skills, so I can program faster, and not rely on auto-complete (but I still use them and keyboard shortcuts) I love VIM! I use combination of technology like audio books, text-to-speech browser extensions, and cut and paste transcripts/captions of videos on my Cherry Tree notes.</p>

<p>For now, even before I automate my workflow, I focus on the basics, repetition, and healthy transition between subjects.</p>

<p>As for CONTEXT SWITCHING, I am aware how focus is necessary, so I do the POMODORO technique as well. Having a healthy transition or even enough rest in between what you are learning can help avoid overload and mental burnout.</p>

<p>Choosing the sequence of what you want to learn is important. They have to be related some how. I explore the overlaps between cybersecurity, programming, administration, cloud, and application development. I wear both a hat of a “generalist” and I guess I can’t avoid my OCD-nature to take over as well.</p>

<p>I also use Anki flash cards/notes and Ankiweb to test what I have retain from what I learned. I also love absorbing recommendations and opinions from others. I follow my curiosities, but limit them so my journey does not fork without purpose and stay on its course.</p>

<h4 id="inspiration"><em>Inspiration</em></h4>

<p>My experience in web development gave me an insight on how important it is for my clients to not only have a full-blown website that is viewable from personal computers and laptops. They reiterated that they want their customers to view their websites from mobile devices. So, I developed websites that are portable, responsive and mobile-friendly, I had used JavaScript Frameworks like Meteor, Adobe PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile and React Native.</p>

<h4 id="android-development"><em>Android Development:</em></h4>

Normally, giving storage space to newer data is a prirority that is why most systems clean up their logs or historical data for after some time. The decrease in cost of storage devices made possible to keep historical logs longer than usual.</p>

<p>The abundance of log files can be utilized to learn about the baseline behavior of ones system and also learn about anomalies that occur historically and use what is learned to predict or assess system behavior.</p>

<p>In this post, I employ the process of “Anomaly Detection”, which is a kind of unsupervised machine learning approach.</p>

<h4 id="anomaly-detection-unsupervised-learning-approach">Anomaly Detection Unsupervised Learning Approach:</h4>

<p>An anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers will be utilized using a dataset that contains two features -</p>

<ol>
  <li>throughput (mb/s) and</li>
  <li>latency (ms) of response of each server.</li>
</ol>

<p>As our servers operate, I collected 𝑚=307
examples of how they were behaving, and thus have an unlabeled dataset {𝑥(1),…,𝑥(𝑚)}</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>The vast majority of these examples are “normal” (non-anomalous) examples of the servers operating normally, but there might also be some examples of servers acting anomalously within this dataset.</p>

<p>I will use a Gaussian model to detect anomalous examples in this dataset.</p>

<p>I will first start on a 2D dataset that will allow me to visualize what the algorithm is doing.</p>

<p>On that dataset I will fit a Gaussian distribution and then find values that have very low probability and hence can be considered anomalies.</p>

<h4 id="the-dataset">The Dataset:</h4>

<p>We will load X_train, X_val and y_val from the dataset.</p>

<p>using X_train to fit a Gaussian distribution
using X_val and y_val as a cross validation set to select a threshold and determine anomalous vs normal examples</p>

<h4 id="plotting-with-estimate-against-a-gaussian-contour">Plotting with Estimate against a Gaussian Contour:</h4>

<p>Plotting this estimate shows that most of the examples are in the region with the highest probability, while the anomalous examples are in the regions with lower probabilities.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary:</h4>

<p>Extracting valuable information from historical data that is continuously collected can be valuable to detect problems in any IT system. Even with a real-time dashboard that can be viewed by IT administrators, it would be a challenge to be vigilant in finding anomalies by merely observing certain metrics visually. IT systems produce a stream of events that need to be sorted out prior to effectively find some valuable insights and machine learning can be employed to help.</p>

<p>This post shows an example of when data about the throughput and latency of a system can be analyzed to sort out potential problems. Other metrics can be utilized and analyzed and fed into an unsupervised learning “Anomaly Detection” program such as demonstrated in this post.</p>]]></content><author><name>NostradmsX</name><email>roygarcia201@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Collecting logs is a standard practice in IT.

This way I can transfer files between my server and any client computer that on my network.</p>

<h4 id="problem">Problem:</h4>
<p>I do not want to keep syncing these two machines and keeping track of duplicate copies. I want to designate a folder on my PopOS machine where I can move, edit and save files to from any computer. This way, any changes I do to files and directories on this Samba folder from my Windows 10 machine will be saved on the PopOS machine. Lastly, I do not need to keep any copy of files on my Windows 10 machine. How do I accomplish this?</p>

<h4 id="solution">Solution:</h4>
<p>It is time to learn about Samba by installing it on my PopOS machine, creating a Samba user and designating a Samba private folder that I can later map from my Windows 10 machine. I followed the instructions from this site: <a href="https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-samba-server-file-share">https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-samba-server-file-share</a></p>

<h4 id="installation">Installation:</h4>

<p>I was able to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin</code> and got these errors:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/01_samba_installation_error.jpg" alt="samba installation error" /></p>

<p>Despite the above errors, I was able to I check for the version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smbd --version</code> and got <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Version 4.12.5-Ubuntu</code>. This is a good sign that Samba  server was installed on my Ubuntu/PopOS machine:</p>

<p>One way to verify is to see if the daemon necessary for Samba works by running: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo systemctl status smbd nmbd</code>. This results:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/02_samba_systemctl_status.jpg" alt="systemctl status to check samba" /></p>

<p>I was able to start Samba using: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo systemctl start smbd nmbd</code></p>

<p>I then proceeded adding a Samba user and Samba group:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/03_samba_user_add.jpg" alt="adding the user and samba folder" /></p>

<p>Also, I created the Samba folder and configured Samba:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/04_samba_folder_add.jpg" alt="Creating the samba folder" /></p>

<p>Restarting Samba using the command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo systemctl restart smbd nmbd</code></p>

<h4 id="mapping-the-samba-folder-in-windows-10-machine">Mapping the samba folder in Windows 10 machine</h4>

<p>Using Windows Explorer, we type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\\10.0.0.152\Private</code> on the address bar and we will be asked to sign in as the Samba user that was created:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/05_samba_windows_map.jpg" alt="mapping the samba folder in Windows 10" /></p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h4>

<p>Samba is one way that Linux machines interoperate with Windows machines. By following the above steps, I am now capable of working on my PopOS Samba folder from any machine that supports Samba and I am able to minimize my workflow by not needing to  worry about redundancies and keenly keeping track of two versions on two machines. I know that there are other and better ways of doing what I wanted to accomplish, but I will explore and write about them next time.</p>

  <li>change my directory from the <em>cmder</em> to one of my destination work folders: my product reviews, local git repositories, and nodejs development folder.</li>
  <li>open the destination folder in Sublime</li>
  <li>open the destination folder in Windows Explorer</li>
  <li>show the path to the current (which was also the destination) folder</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the simple PowerShell script:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/tutorials/gotoreviewps1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>to run it on <em>cmder</em>, I just type:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gotoreview.ps1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is the simple Bash script:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/tutorials/gotoreviewsh.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>to run it on <em>cmder</em>, I just type:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source gotoreview.sh
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>. gotoreview.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Notes</em>: When running the <em>Bash</em> version of the program from cmder, <em>always</em> precede the filename with “source” or a “.” in order for change directory to work. Without it, the sublime command will run and windows explorer will open, but on you will not change directory to your TARGET folder. See the images below:</p>

As a <strong>designer</strong>, developer and even a self-proclaimed artist, I often struggle with finalizing any project or creation that I have to offer to clients, students, or audience. The notion of change, movement, refactoring, versioning, evolution and other variation of not being complacent with the “current moment” engulf my mind. Even when I find the clarity to put a period, deadline or finality on whatever I am saying, working on, or creating, something at the back of my mind expects that one day I would have to revisit these <em>obra maestro</em>.</p>

<p>As a <strong>programmer</strong>, I flood my codes with comments and instructions to my future self. As a <strong>musician</strong>, I record or transcibe various versions of my music. As a <strong>learner</strong>, I take notes, keep all the revisions I make on assignments, and save local copies of files I submit to my instructors.</p>

<p>Most of these works are time-stamped and I can try to go back and compare the differences if I make any errors on the most recent copy. Doing this manually is really hard and this is where version control systems like git can help.</p>

<p>If anyone asks me why I need to learn <strong>git</strong> and point out some existing commands on Windows like fc = file change or diff in Mac OSX or Linux, I find myself typing the few <em>git commands</em> I know by heart to demonstrate its superiority over existing commands. I know that the creators of these commands meant well, but in terms of comparing minute differences between files in a large scale development or production environment, git works best.</p>

<p>Git enables its user to view historical versions of the file and every commit to any change has to be logged. Of course, the quality of comments you attached to every change matters, but you can also review the actual differences within the file. Having accesss to the entire history of a file help make a programmer efficient by giving a sense of comfort that even if the program breaks, the code that caused the break can be easily located and corrected.</p>

This article is a glimpse on how such preprocessing is necessesary to have some meaningful and unbiased information from big data …</p>

<p><strong>PART ONE</strong></p>

<p>Prior to data analysis, acquiring data and preparing them to be analyzed requires the following procedures:</p>

<p><em>Raw Data -&gt; Processing Script -&gt; Tidy Data -&gt; Data Analysis -&gt; Data Communication</em></p>

<p>The raw data for this project will be exported as Comma Separated Values or CSV files from exports of a computer firewall and a packet capture tool, like Wireshark. It is important to make sure that the data is ideal to be imported to data analysis tools. Ideal data to be used for analysis has the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every single row has an observation</li>
  <li>Every single column has one variable</li>
</ul>

<p>Definition of Data: “Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.” (wikipedia).</p>

<p>set of items = population or set of objects of interest
values = variables that we want to measure
qualitative:  what types of protocol: TCP, FIX, or UDP; source IP Address: 192.168.32.0
quantitative:  measurable data like time, detla time, number of bytes, etc..</p>

<p>As we can see with the case of IP Addresses, not all numbers are quantitative in nature. Processing data from raw data to tidy data is done using packages in R. All steps in data processing should be recorded and this can be done via Git or Github,</p>

<p>www.howtogeek.com has a page devoted to explaining what Git or Github is: “Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Trovalds – the same person who created Linux. Git is similar to other version control systems – Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.”</p>

<p>It is critical to pay attention to what is happening to the data while going through processing is crucial to analysis, so any tools that help preserve the history of the data that is being processed will help in times we need to present that data has not been altered or reconfigured, revert back to an older version, etc…</p>

<p>Changes in data, especially data related to computing, may be hard to monitor by human senses. However, machine learning procedures or data analysis can use the combination of tools to analyze each stages or changing variables that may later form the signature corresponding to a particular exploitation.</p>

<p><strong>PART TWO</strong></p>

<p>For this project, data coming from various sources are added frequently. At minimal, getting enough data to get some meaningful analysis will just be packet capture lasting a few minutes since storing these logs is dependent on how big the storage is. Real-time analysis can be limited to “the past 30 minutes of packet capture” for this project, but ultimately, data should be streaming to R. It still needs to be processed:</p>

<p>The original source data -&gt; few R programs responsible to process data -&gt; from raw data, a small subset will be cleaned to get ready for analysis -&gt; (output) subset data that will be inputted to R programs responsible for explanatory analysis</p>

<p>One process for tidying up data may include specification of variables, elimination of information that are not needed, computation of derive information, and checking if data can be managed by the computer’s memory. All these may also involve merging, sub-setting, and transformation of data. It is critical to pay attention and record all the steps done to the data.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/datascience/dataprocessingdiagram.jpg" alt="data pipeline" /></p>

<p>In the end of data clean up, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) input should have:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Original Raw Data</li>
  <li>Processed or tidy data
    <ul>
      <li>each variable measured in one column</li>
      <li>each observation of variable in one row</li>
      <li>one table for each “kind” of variable</li>
      <li>multiple tables should be linked by a variable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>metadata = describes the relationship between values and variables</li>
  <li>version/history print = footprints of how data evolved from raw to tidy, algorithm from 1 to next steps.. so forth..</li>
  <li>Save one file per table</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>PART THREE</strong></p>

<p>Most raw data come from various sources, including servers located online. Although it is easy to right click and download a file to a local folder and fetch those files from that folder, it is better to actually include the download script within the R script that will be using the data.</p>

<p>A review of R commands that might be helpful in the creation of automated scripts is listed below:</p>

I started with Coursera’s offering from the John Hopkins’ Data Science Specialization: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhudatascience">link to the Data Science course in coursera.org</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/datascience/jilcoursera.JPG" alt="John Hopkins Universeity Data Science course list" /></p>

<p>They provide certifications that you can attach to your Linkedin’s profile. I learned a lot from the courses regarding the application of Data Science in various scientific fields. We learned how to input datasets of various forms: CSV, JSON’s, HDFS, and also from different API’s. Here is one example of a project I had finished from the courses:</p>

<p><a href="http://rpubs.com/journeylearner/">link to my Rpubs page</a></p>

<p>We learned the R programming language, which is often preferred by most data scientists as a language to learn. However, this is not the only programming language to learn. A lot of Data Scientists uses Microsoft’s Excel, especially if you will be involved in business. Data scientists use programming and presentation skills to tell a story about how important a certain study of data is to finding business opportunities, and/or creating real-time decisions to create an advantage over competition: A MOOC that I would suggest in addition to the above data science specialization is offered by Duke University: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/excel-mysql">link here</a>.</p>

<p>In this class, the professor provides a thorough study on what it takes to be a data science, and even provide enough information on how his students got their jobs within the data science industry. He would have guest speakers from former students that are currently working as data scientists, business analysts, and business data analysts. There is even enough information to distinguish a data scientist’s job from a software engineer’s, or how a data scientist works along side the other three jobs. Here are sample screenshots from this course:</p>

However, it would be expensive if we rely on human to do collection, observation and analysis. Data Science can help automate this task …</p>

<p>The goal of the experiment is to be able to provide a Real-time Automated Dashboard (RAD) that security analysts can observe to look at visuals describing the security state of a certain systems observed. The visuals will be properly labeled and make use of colors to distinguish normal state versus “possible exploited” state. Ideally, all graphs will be created from R objects that have been cleaned and processed for exploration. The aim is to be able to create meaningful information that can be used for decisions and further understand the system in real-time.</p>

<p>Another goal of the experiment is to create standard R-packages that would aid in creating exploratory graphs. The design would take all variables in consideration and provide the user to choose which variable goes on the x or y axis at a specified scope in time. Graphics can then be displayed to alongside each other for comparison, as long as the user specifies a slice or scope of time to be observed: varies from real-time minus delay or exploratory for historical data.</p>

<p>RAD will compose of multiple views of multi-variable data. A set of presets can be defaulted to having three sets of  2 x 2 graphs that shows random combination of variables from a certain R dataset. The user can then select particular variables to show up for customized graph for observation: below are sample graphs created by an R package ggplot.

<p>sample dashboard panel:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/datascience/dashboard2.jpg" alt="sample dashboard panel" /></p>

<p>RAD will be composed of visual graphics created from R data sets and they provide summary of the data in real-time and historically. Analysts can use these to further look into certain data that collaborates their hypothesis or establish doubts and provide enough evidence to rule out some generalizations.</p>

<p>One-dimensional summaries of data include: boxplots, histograms, density plot, and bar plots:</p>

These two are often required in most courses I took from teachers in traditional, online, and MOOC schools. As I progress in my career in computer security, I advocate the search for the right balance in security and privacy. I currently help local companies to embrace the need of security while providing ease in computing and acquiring the peace of mind that data is projected.</p>

<p>The first type of document is a <strong>Disaster Recovery Plan</strong> or DRP. In his article about what lessons we can get from September 11, Dave Shore, a former member of the Institute of Directors in the UK, states that even the best-laid plans can fail. “However, the 9/11 disaster is an extreme scenario and we can just be pragmatic and say that disaster recovery plans (DRP) can help save most critical part of any organization’s financial investment, marketing efforts, customer loyalty, etc”</p>

<p>According to an article by Dave Shore, <em>“A frequently issued statistic regarding disaster recovery is that one in five organizations that suffer a major incident never recover and end up going out of business.”</em> (Shore, 2002) It provides solution or guidance to how an organization can identify, analyze and prioritize their response to certain kind of disasters that has the potential to negatively affect the company. Ultimately, it provides a solution to the question on how the company can bring itself up on its feet. The purpose of the DRP is not to provide false hope nor make the organization invincible and immune to any kind of disaster. What DRP provide is to make sure that business can prevail with the least amount of negative effect to the organization. Organizations may need to allocate resources and budget for auxiliary offices or some data warehousing contracts with another company.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/computersecurity/sampledrp.jpg" alt="A picture of a sample Disaster Recovery Plan Template" /></p>

<p>Another blog article that I found useful in providing readers an example of a document that computer security students and managers should learn is a Wordpress blog entitled “The Reluctant Blogger” by Angie Legge. The document is called a <strong>Risk Register</strong>. As Angie wrote on her blog: “Risk registers can do more than this, but it is vital to get the basics right first. Then, as a manager, you can feel that you have a good handle on the key risks, and demonstrate this easily to those senior to you.” The basic features of a risk register includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>description of issues</li>
  <li>risk score for prioritization</li>
  <li>what control is in place</li>
  <li>what is being done to help make risk less likely to happen</li>
  <li>progress</li>
</ol>

<p>(more complete guide available <a href="https://angielegge.wordpress.com/?s=risk+register">“The Reluctant Blogger” by Angie Legge</a>)</p>

<p>Now, as you learn more about both the technical part of computer security, put in mind that you may need to convey both your concerns and solutions as part any one of the two documents you have learned from this blog: DRP or Disaster Recovery Plan and/or RR or Risk Register. Feel free to bookmark the above resources I used and visit this blog once more.
